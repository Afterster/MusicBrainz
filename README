Welcome to phpbrainz2!

This project is a fork of phpbrainz updating the library to use the newer (v2)
XML API provided by MusicBrainz (http://musicbrainz.org).

NOTE: work on this hasn't begun yet. This is the initial commit.


Original phpbrainz README:

This is an OO PHP 5 library for accessing the musicbrainz API. To search the
API, there are two different methods to access the musicbrainz API. One is a
search based on criteria such as artist name, track name, release year, etc.
The other is a retrieval of a specific musicbrainz record based on a specific
identifier for the musicbrainz database (MBID). Typically you search for
results using a release, track, or artist filter, then from those results
retrieve the specific record you want with the detailed information. There are
examples in the examples folder.
